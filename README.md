## 🔍 Overview
Swetcha is an **AI-powered real-time harassment detection system** designed to enhance women’s safety by leveraging **computer vision, deep learning, and video captioning**. The system seamlessly integrates with **CCTV surveillance networks** to detect suspicious behavior, classify human interactions, and generate real-time alerts to law enforcement.

This project is inspired by the growing need for **proactive public safety measures** and aims to bridge the gap between **traditional monitoring systems and AI-driven security solutions**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time monitoring** of human interactions using **computer vision**.
- **Gender classification** and **behavior analysis** to detect suspicious activities.
- **Video captioning** for generating **detailed incident reports**.
- **Automated alert system** that sends **real-time notifications** to law enforcement.
- **Seamless integration** with existing **CCTV infrastructure**.
- **Adaptive learning** to **reduce false positives** over time.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Women’s safety remains a **global concern**, with traditional **manual surveillance systems** being **inefficient and reactive**. **Delayed responses, underreporting, and lack of technological intervention** often leave victims vulnerable. Swetcha aims to **automate harassment detection**, ensuring **timely intervention and enhanced security**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Deep Learning (CNNs, Vision Transformers)**
- **MediaPipe for pose detection**
- **OpenCV for real-time video processing**
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for video captioning**
- **Flask/Django for API Integration**
- **SQL/NoSQL Databases for alert storage**

## 🔧 How It Works
1. **Live CCTV Feed Processing**: The system receives live video input from surveillance cameras.
2. **Human Segmentation & Gender Classification**: Detects individuals and categorizes them by gender.
3. **Behavior Analysis**: Identifies interactions and classifies them as **normal** or **abnormal**.
4. **Threat Escalation Logic**: If abnormal behavior persists for 15 seconds, an alert is triggered.
5. **Video Captioning**: AI generates a textual summary of the incident.
6. **Automated Alert System**: Sends location, video footage, and incident details to **police stations**.


## 📊 Performance & Results
- Achieved **high accuracy in gender classification and behavior detection**.
- Reduced **false positive rates** using **adaptive feedback loops**.
- Generated **real-time alerts with high precision** in **live CCTV setups**.

## 🏆 Future Enhancements
- **Integrate with IoT-based smart city infrastructures** for wider public safety.
- **Enhance audio analysis** to detect verbal harassment.
- **Optimize deployment on edge devices** for low-cost, scalable solutions.
